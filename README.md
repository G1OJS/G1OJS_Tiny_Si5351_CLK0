# G1OJS_Tiny_Si5351_CLK0
Sets Si5351 CLK0 frequency from 100 MHz to 150 MHz using just 1446 bytes of program storage space on an ATTiny85.

I wrote this to 
  - learn how to program the Si5351
  - create material that links that learning directly to the guidance and nomenclature in the datasheet and application note
  - support my [Airband Scanner On An ATTiny85 project](https://github.com/G1OJS/ATTiny85-Scanner-Radio) (different repo, not an example here).

I hope you find it useful for the same or similar reasons!
