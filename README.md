# G1OJS_Tiny_Si5351_CLK0
Sets Si5351 CLK0 frequency from 100 MHz to 150 MHz using just 1446 bytes of program storage space on an ATTiny85.

I wrote this to a) try to understand how to program the Si5351 and b) to support my [Airband Scanner On An ATTiny85 project](https://github.com/G1OJS/ATTiny85-Scanner-Radio).
